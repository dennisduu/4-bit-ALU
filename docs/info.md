## How it works

An ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a key component in digital circuits that performs arithmetic and logical operations. In this design, we have an ALU that operates on 4-bit inputs (meaning it processes numbers in the range of 0 to 15). The ALU performs different operations depending on the opcode (a code that tells the ALU which operation to perform).


## How to test

1. Input Configuration: The 4-bit binary numbers a and b are provided via the upper and lower halves of the 8-bit input (ui_in). The upper 4 bits represent one operand (a), and the lower 4 bits represent the other operand (b).
The operation to be performed is selected using the 4-bit opcode provided via the uio_in input.

2. Running the Design: To test the adder:
*Set the input values (a and b) by configuring ui_in.
*Select the operation by setting the uio_in input to the corresponding opcode.
*Ensure the design is powered by setting ena active and release the reset signal (rst_n set to 1).
*Observe the result of the operation on the uo_out output. The exact meaning of the result will depend on the operation:
**For arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV), uo_out will show the result of the operation.
**For logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), uo_out will contain the logical result.
**For comparison operations (SLT, SEQ), the least significant bit (LSB) of uo_out will indicate the comparison result (either 0 or 1).
*Additionally, for operations like ADD and SUB, carry-out and overflow flags can be observed on the upper bits of uio_out.

3. Example Test:
ADD Operation:

Input: a = 4'b0011 (3), b = 4'b0101 (5), opcode = ADD (0b0000).
Set ui_in: ui_in = 8'b01010011.
Expected Output: Sum 8 â†’ uo_out = 8'b00001000 (4-bit sum), uio_out[6] = 0 (carry-out).
